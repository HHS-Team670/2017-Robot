# 2017-Robot
Code for Team 670's Steamworks Robot

UPDATE (2/12/17): FIRST is nice, but as always updates disable us for long periods of time. The SRX CANTalon libraries have been disabled, so now need to go to: http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources, to install the update library (Only on Windows)
