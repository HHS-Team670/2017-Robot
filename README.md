Updates

**(2/12/17):** 
FIRST is nice, but as always, updates disable us for long periods of time. The SRX CANTalon libraries have been disabled, so now need to go to: http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources, to install the update library (Only on Windows) --> NEVER OPEN THIS PROJECT ON A MAC OR PC WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM INSTALLED
